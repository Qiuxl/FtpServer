# FtpServer
this is a simple FTP server, able to communicate with the Ftp client I wrote before. Â 
* 1. before running this code, you should close the firewall, otherwise it will fails when sending data to client.(I haven't figure out why)
* 2. this server run with single thread, and it can't server for multiple client concurrently.
